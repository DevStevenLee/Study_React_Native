# React Native Study

## > For Whom?

> This study is for programmers who have been studying React Native with the course, https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-react-native-and-redux-course/ in Udemy. I commented for everything that i had not understood in the code.  you can follow the course easily with my record. Most of the comments are written in Korean so you got to know how to speak Korean at least. (I will update for English version later)
